# ðŸŽ¬ FILMINATOR 9000 v2 â€“ Movie Management and Website Generator
Filminator 9000 is a Python-based Flask web application that allows users to manage their own movie database through a sleek and interactive browser interface. Instead of a command-line tool, the project now delivers a fully dynamic web experience, using Flask for routing and templating, and SQLAlchemy as the database ORM.
The app connects to the OMDb API to fetch detailed movie information â€” including posters â€” which are then stored in a local SQL database. Users can easily add, view, update, or delete movies through intuitive web forms. The application dynamically renders HTML pages using Jinja templates, displaying movie data in clean, responsive Bootstrap-styled cards.
Whether you're a film enthusiast or learning web development, MoviWeb demonstrates how to build and deploy a full-stack Flask app that combines real-world APIs, database integration, and user-friendly UI â€” all in one project.
